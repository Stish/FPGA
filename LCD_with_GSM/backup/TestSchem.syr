INFO:Xst:738 - HDL ADVISOR - 1608 flip-flops were inferred for signal <data>. You may be trying to describe a RAM in a way that is incompatible with block and distributed RAM resources available on Xilinx devices, or with a specific template that is not supported. Please review the Xilinx resources documentation and the XST user manual for coding guidelines. Taking advantage of RAM resources will lead to improved device usage and reduced synthesis time.

WARNING:Xst:1290 - Hierarchical block <XLXI_9> is unconnected in block <TestSchem>.
   It will be removed from the design.
WARNING:Xst:1710 - FF/Latch <cmd_6> (without init value) has a constant value of 0 in block <XLXI_8>. This FF/Latch will be trimmed during the optimization process.

Synthesizing (advanced) Unit <Test_Data_out>.
INFO:Xst:3034 - In order to maximize performance and save block RAM resources, the small ROM <Mrom__varindex0000> will be implemented on LUT. If you want to force its implementation on block, use option/constraint rom_style.
Unit <Test_Data_out> synthesized (advanced).
